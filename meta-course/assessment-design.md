## ðŸ“‹ Quiz Construction Methodology

Following the systematic approach for effective quiz development:

### Phase I: Framework Definition and Objectives

#### Assessment Categories
1. **Knowledge Recall**: Factual information and terminology
2. **Comprehension**: Understanding of concepts and principles
3. **Application**: Practical use of skills and techniques
4. **Analysis**: Code evaluation and debugging
5. **Synthesis**: Integration of multiple concepts
6. **Evaluation**: Critical assessment and decision-making

#### Variable Definition
- **Primary Variable**: AI-assisted web development competency
- **Sub-variables**: 
  - AI tool proficiency
  - JavaScript programming skills
  - Web development knowledge
  - Security awareness
  - Problem-solving ability
  - Code quality assessment

#### Application Context
- **Format**: Digital, integrated with Claude Code environment
- **Timing**: Self-paced with optional time limits
- **Setting**: Individual assessment with AI assistance permitted
- **Purpose**: Formative feedback and summative evaluation

### Phase II: Item Construction

#### Item Types and Distribution

##### 1. Multiple Choice Questions (40% of assessments)
**Construction Guidelines:**
- **Stem Quality**: Clear, concise, and focused on essential knowledge
- **Option Count**: 3-4 options with one clearly correct answer
- **Distractor Design**: Plausible but clearly incorrect for knowledgeable learners

**Example Structure:**
```
When using Claude Code's plan mode, what is the PRIMARY benefit for complex development tasks?

A) Faster code execution and performance optimization
B) Structured problem-solving approach with step-by-step planning
C) Automatic debugging and error correction
D) Direct database access and manipulation

Feedback:
- A: Incorrect - Plan mode focuses on planning, not execution speed
- B: Correct - Plan mode helps break down complex tasks systematically
- C: Incorrect - Plan mode is for planning, not automatic debugging
- D: Incorrect - Plan mode doesn't provide direct database access
```

##### 2. Code Identification and Analysis (25% of assessments)
**Format**: Present code snippets with questions about functionality, errors, or improvements

**Example:**
```javascript
const fetchUserData = async (userId) => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);
    const userData = response.json();
    return userData;
};
```

**Question**: What is the primary issue with this code?
- Missing error handling for failed requests
- Incorrect async/await syntax
- **Missing await keyword before response.json()** âœ“
- Improper function naming convention

##### 3. Short Answer/Completion (20% of assessments)
**Application**: Code completion, concept explanation, and practical scenarios

**Example**: 
"Complete the Express.js middleware function for user authentication:
```javascript
const authenticateUser = (req, res, next) => {
    const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
    if (!token) {
        return res.status(401).json({ error: _____________ });
    }
    // Complete the function...
};
```"

##### 4. True/False with Justification (10% of assessments)
**Structure**: Statement with required explanation of reasoning

**Example**:
"True or False: Claude Code's plan mode should be used for every programming task, regardless of complexity.
**Answer**: False
**Justification**: Plan mode is most beneficial for complex tasks that benefit from structured breakdown. Simple, straightforward tasks may not require the planning overhead."

##### 5. Matching/Correspondence (5% of assessments)
**Application**: Connect concepts to implementations, tools to purposes

**Example**:
Match each security principle to its implementation:
- Input Validation â†’ Sanitizing user input before database operations
- Authentication â†’ Verifying user identity with JWT tokens
- Authorization â†’ Checking user permissions for specific resources
- Encryption â†’ Securing sensitive data in transit and at rest

### Phase III: Distractor Development

- Outdated practices that were once correct
- Overgeneralized principles

##### 3. Technical Precision

- Proper implementation with security flaws
- Functional code with performance issues

### Phase IV: Pilot Testing and Refinement

#### Testing Protocol
1. **Expert Review**: Subject matter experts evaluate technical accuracy
2. **Student Pilot**: Small group testing with think-aloud protocols
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Item difficulty and discrimination indices
4. **Bias Review**: Cultural and accessibility considerations

#### Refinement Criteria
- **Item Difficulty**: Target 60-80% correct response rate
- **Discrimination Index**: Minimum 0.3 for effective differentiation
- **Response Distribution**: All distractors should attract some responses
- **Time Requirements**: Reasonable completion time without rushing
