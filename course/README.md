# Claude Code Development Course

## üéØ Course Overview

This comprehensive course teaches modern web development through AI-assisted programming using Claude Code. Students will build a complete full-stack application (the doctorate-programs-evaluator) while learning to leverage AI tools effectively.

### üéì Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will achieve **90% confidence** in:
- Independently editing and enhancing existing codebases
- Building full-stack web applications with AI assistance
- Implementing secure, scalable backend systems
- Creating responsive, interactive user interfaces
- Working collaboratively with AI tools like Claude Code

### üìö Course Structure

The course follows **Gagn√©'s Nine Events of Instruction** and incorporates evidence-based instructional design principles. Each module builds upon previous knowledge while providing hands-on practice with real-world scenarios.
