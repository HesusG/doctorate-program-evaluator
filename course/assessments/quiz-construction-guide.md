```

#### Example Template: Application Level
```
You're building a user authentication system and want Claude Code to help with security best practices. Which prompt would be MOST effective?

A) "Make user login secure"
B) "Create authentication with passwords"
C) "Help me implement secure user authentication for a Node.js/Express app, including password hashing, session management, and input validation" ✓
D) "Write login code with security"

Feedback:
A: Too vague - doesn't specify technology stack, requirements, or security aspects needed.
B: Missing critical context about platform, security requirements, and implementation details.
C: Correct! Provides clear context (Node.js/Express), specific security requirements, and actionable scope.
D: Lacks specificity about platform, security measures, and implementation requirements.
```

### 2. Code Analysis Questions (25% of assessments)

#### Structure and Purpose
- Present authentic code snippets with realistic issues or optimization opportunities
- Focus on common AI-generated code patterns and potential improvements
- Include both correct and incorrect code examples
- Test ability to evaluate AI-generated solutions critically

#### Example Template: Analysis Level
```
Examine this AI-generated Express.js route handler:

```javascript
app.get('/users/:id', async (req, res) => {
    const userData = await db.collection('users').findOne({_id: req.params.id});
    res.json(userData);
});
```

What is the PRIMARY issue with this code that should be addressed before production use?

A) The route path should use a different HTTP method
B) Missing error handling for database operations and invalid user IDs ✓
C) The variable name 'userData' should be more descriptive
D) The async/await syntax is incorrectly implemented

Feedback:
A: GET is appropriate for retrieving user data; the HTTP method is correct for this use case.
B: Correct! The code lacks error handling for database failures, missing users, and invalid ID formats - critical for production.
C: While descriptive names are good practice, this is not the primary security/functionality issue.
D: The async/await syntax is correctly implemented; the issue is missing error handling.
```

### 3. Short Answer/Completion Questions (20% of assessments)

#### Application Guidelines
- Test practical application of concepts in realistic scenarios
- Allow for multiple correct approaches when appropriate
- Provide clear evaluation criteria for partial credit
- Focus on essential skills that can't be assessed through multiple choice

#### Example Template: Application Level
```
Complete the Claude Code prompt for creating a responsive navigation menu:

"Help me create a responsive navigation menu for a portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu should _________________ on mobile devices and include _________________ for accessibility."

Expected answers include:
- "collapse/transform into a hamburger menu" AND "proper ARIA labels/keyboard navigation"
- "stack vertically/hide behind a toggle" AND "focus management/screen reader support"
- "become a dropdown/slide menu" AND "semantic HTML structure/accessible controls"

Scoring:
- 2 points: Both responsive behavior and accessibility features mentioned
- 1 point: Either responsive behavior OR accessibility mentioned correctly
- 0 points: Neither aspect addressed or incorrect information provided
```

### 4. True/False with Justification (10% of assessments)

#### Purpose and Structure
- Test understanding of nuanced concepts and common misconceptions
- Require explanation to demonstrate comprehension, not just recognition
- Address critical safety and best practice issues
- Identify and correct oversimplified thinking

#### Example Template: Comprehension Level
```
True or False: AI-generated code is always secure and ready for production use without review.

Answer: _____ (True/False)

Justification (required): _________________________________

Correct Answer: False

Acceptable justifications include:
- AI-generated code requires human review for security vulnerabilities
- AI may not understand specific security requirements or contexts
- Code must be tested and validated regardless of source
- AI can introduce subtle bugs or security issues that need human detection
- Production readiness requires more than functional code (testing, documentation, etc.)

Scoring:

## 🎨 Distractor Development Strategies

### 1. Common Student Errors
Base incorrect options on actual student misconceptions and frequent mistakes:

#### AI Tool Misconceptions
- Overestimating AI capabilities ("AI can automatically fix all bugs")
- Underestimating human oversight needs ("AI code never needs testing")
- Misunderstanding feature purposes ("Plan mode is for quick code generation")

#### Technical Misconceptions
- Syntax errors that look plausible
- Security practices that seem reasonable but are flawed
- Performance assumptions that are commonly held but incorrect

### 2. Plausible but Incorrect Alternatives
Create distractors that would appeal to learners with partial understanding:

#### Near-Miss Technical Solutions
- Correct approach but wrong implementation
- Right technology but inappropriate configuration
- Proper concept but incorrect application context

#### Logical but Incomplete Thinking
- Solutions that address part of the problem
- Approaches that work in simple cases but fail in complex scenarios
- Methods that ignore important constraints or requirements

### 3. Avoid These Distractor Pitfalls
- **"All of the above" or "None of the above"** - These often have poor statistical performance
- **Absurd or ridiculous options** - Too easy to eliminate, reducing question effectiveness
- **Grammatical inconsistencies** - Can provide unintended clues to correct answers
- **Obvious length differences** - Correct answers shouldn't be consistently longer or shorter

## 📊 Question Difficulty and Validation

### Target Difficulty Levels

#### By Module Progression
- **Modules 1-2 (Fundamentals)**: 60-70% average correct response rate
- **Modules 3-5 (Core Skills)**: 65-75% average correct response rate
- **Modules 6-8 (Advanced Topics)**: 70-80% average correct response rate
- **Modules 9-10 (Integration/Advanced)**: 75-85% average correct response rate

### Statistical Validation Criteria

#### Item Analysis Requirements
- **Discrimination Index**: Minimum 0.3 for question retention
- **Response Distribution**: All distractors should attract some responses
- **Correlation with Total Score**: Positive correlation required
- **Time Requirements**: 1-2 minutes per multiple choice question

#### Bias and Fairness Review
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Avoid culturally specific references
- **Language Complexity**: Use clear, accessible language
- **Accessibility**: Compatible with screen readers and assistive technologies
- **Gender Neutral**: Use inclusive language and examples

## 🔄 Feedback Design Standards

### Immediate Feedback Components

#### For Correct Responses
- **Confirmation**: "Correct! You've identified the key concept."
- **Reinforcement**: Brief explanation of why the answer is right
- **Extension**: Connection to broader learning objectives
- **Application**: Hint about where this knowledge applies in practice

#### For Incorrect Responses
- **Gentle Correction**: "Not quite. Let's explore why this isn't the best option."
- **Explanation**: Clear reasoning about why the choice is incorrect
- **Guidance**: Hint toward the correct thinking process
- **Learning Direction**: Suggestion for additional study or practice

#### Example Feedback Structure
```
Selected Answer A: "Make user login secure"

Feedback: "This prompt is too vague for effective AI assistance. While security is the right goal, Claude Code needs specific context about your technology stack (Node.js, Python, etc.), particular security requirements (password hashing, session management), and implementation details to provide useful guidance. Try rephrasing with more specific technical requirements."

Hint: "Think about what information a human developer would need to help you with authentication - Claude Code needs similar context."

Study Suggestion: "Review Module 1, Section 4 on effective prompt engineering for specific examples of detailed technical prompts."
